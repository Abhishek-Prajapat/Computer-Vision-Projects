# SIIM-FISABIO-RSNA COVID-19 Detection

In this problem you are provided with a study over a patient and you have to identify if that study is abnormal or not. In each study there are several dicom files of the patient and each file contains a pixel array which contains the image of the chest and lungs which radiologists use to identify.
Also Given each image you have to do object-detection and create a bounding box over the area of abnoramlity if the abnormality exists.

For the following problem I created a the gigantic of model of EfficientNetB7 and trained over a tpu on kaggle.
